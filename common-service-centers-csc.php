            <p class="mb-4"><strong>Common Service Centers (CSCs) </strong>are village-level entrepreneurs who provide various government services to citizens in rural areas of India. They act as the access points for government services, enabling digital delivery of government programs. CSCs are playing a vital role in bridging the digital divide in India and bringing government services closer to the people. They are empowering citizens, especially in rural areas, by providing them with access to essential services and digital tools.</p>
